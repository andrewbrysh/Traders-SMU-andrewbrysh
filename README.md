# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

*Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

My interest in quantitative finance stems from my broader interest in the finance industry, particularly with hedge funds and S&T. I've since become fascinated with the industry and have read books and done research about the field. Some STEM courses I have taken include AP Stats in high school and Calc 2 at SMU. I am currently on track to complete the BBA in Finance and BA in Mathematics. I do not have any coding experience. My trading experience is limited to long only plays in crypto, indices, and some individual equities. My equity plays were based only on fundamental analysis of the company's financial statements and competitive position. I do not currently hold any long positions in individual equities.


## 2. Career Goals

As a freshman, I am currently casting wide net. I want to set my goals with both ambition and reality in mind. In a perfect world, I want to recruit for a Connecticut hedge fund like BAM, AQR, Bridgewater, Point72, Graham, Stone Point, Ellington, etc. However, these roles are very competitive and SMU doesn't have a presence at these firms. Instead, it's more realistic to recruit for IB or S&T (NY or HTX) first and lateral over to a multi strat shop. Coming from SMU, it would be to my advantage to work on an energy/commodities desk for a couple of years just because of the reputation that our school holds. Then, I can leverage my network in CT to possibly find a role. 


## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

Currently, I have no experience with coding. My first and foremost goal is to be proficient with Python, and then to learn C++ and possibly R. Coding is a skill that is all but required to be hired as a trader these days. I also want to learn how to use math and ML to understand markets and create trading strategies. Another one of my goals is to learn the derivatives market at an advanced level (options, futures, and swaps). I also hope to network and interview prep to improve my soft skills. Overall, I hope to become a more well rounded student and person through this club.


## 4. Current Technical Skills

- *Programming languages (Python, R, etc.)* Beginner
- *Data analysis tools* Beginner
- *Statistical analysis* Intermediate
- *Financial modeling* Intermediate
- *Machine learning* Beginner
- *Version control (Git)* Beginner
- *Other relevant skills* Beginner: Other relevant skills include: Accounting and Economics

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals


- *Specific skills you plan to develop during this program*: Python, possible C++ and R. Trading strategies and portfolio composition/optimization: Stat arb, merger arb, pair trading, mean reversion, L/S equity, Delta hedging and market neutral strategies, volatility  management, trading/hedging with derivatives.
- *How you will measure your progress*: The items I've listed are binary; either I know them or I don't. I will measure my success by my ability to use and implement the items above.
- *Time commitment you're planning to dedicate each week*: Other than club sessions, I hope to spend 4-6 hours per week on homework and research. During project season, I expect to spend more time.
- *Resources you'll use beyond the program materials*: Youtube resources like Coding Jesus, Fancy Quant, and The Math Sorcerer, I have PDF copies of some of the books listed on Notion, particularly Option volatility and pricing strategies by Sheldon Natenberg. Also, Khan Academy and Harvard have free Coding/Python courses that I may complete if I have time. 
- *Your definition of success for this program*: I would feel especially successful if I landed a hedge fund offer straight out of school, but this is very ambitious. At a minimum, I want to be a proficient coder and have a strong understanding of financial markets and how I can apply math/stats/ML to create an edge.
